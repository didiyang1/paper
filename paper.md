partical size was measured using pcasp(Bloggs et al 2004)

Jone 1998 conducted several studies in this reggion
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made

a large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which meaurements in the literature can be applied at a
reagi

# results

the simulation works good
# Figures
figures go in theri own section in the draft paper.
